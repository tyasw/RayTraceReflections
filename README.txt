Project: Ray Trace Reflections

Ray Trace Reflections is similar to Ray Trace Shadows. It implements both
shadows and reflections. The reflection calculation is not efficient (yet).

How to run:
To compile Ray Trace Reflections, run the following command:

	javac RayTraceReflections.java

To run Ray Trace Reflections, run the following command:

	java RayTraceReflections

The program will then prompt the user for the number of spheres they want
drawn, and other various questions.
